            <li>PHP extensions: cURL, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, XML, Ctype, JSON, BCMath</li>
            <li>URL rewrite enabled.</li>

        <h2>Installation</h2>

        <h3 class="text-muted">Step 1</h3>
        <p>
            Download the application package from CodeCanyon, unzip it and upload the contents to the web root folder of your domain
            (on shared hosting environments the web root folder is usually named <b>public_html</b>).
        </p>
        <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Note for VPS or dedicated server users</h4>
            <p>
                If you install the application on a VPS or dedicated server please
                ensure that the web server (usually www-data user) has write permissions to the following folders:    
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>.. (web root)</li>
                <li>bootstrap/cache</li>
                <li>public</li>
                <li>storage</li>
                <li>storage/app/public/games</li>
                <li>storage/framework</li>
                <li>storage/framework/cache</li>
                <li>storage/framework/sessions</li>
                <li>storage/framework/views</li>
                <li>storage/logs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The easiest way to ensure proper permission is to make www-data user owner of the above folders (and files recursively).
                It can be done with the following shell commands:
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <pre>&gt;_ cd /var/www/myproject
&gt;_ chown www-data public_html
&gt;_ cd public_html
&gt;_ chown www-data public
&gt;_ chown -R www-data storage bootstrap/cache</pre>
            <p>
                Please also check that <b>URL rewrite</b> is <b>enabled</b> and custom .htaccess files are allowed
                (<b>AllowOverride</b> directive set to <b>All</b>) in the Apache web server configuration.
                You can check the latter by inspecting your virtual host config file (e.g. /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/yourwebsite.conf)
                or the main Apache config (/etc/apache2/apache2.conf). It should contain a block similar to this:
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <pre>&lt;Directory /var/www/myproject/public_html/&gt;
    Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    <b>AllowOverride All</b>
    Require all granted
    Order allow,deny
    allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre>
            <p>Please note that you need to restart the Apache service after making configuration changes.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-muted">Step 2</h3>
        <p>Create a MySQL (or MariaDB) database on your server, as well as a database user who has all privileges for accessing and modifying it.</p>

        <h3 class="text-muted">Step 3</h3>
        <p>
            Run the application installation script by accessing the following URL in a web browser: <b>http://yourwebsite.com/install.php</b>
            (substitute yourwebsite.com with your actual domain name). Follow the on-screen setup instructions to complete the installation.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-muted">After installation</h3>
        <p>
            Please make sure to add a system cron job in order to automatically execute scheduled tasks (such as market data update).
            The system cron job parameters are provided on the last step of installation and on the <b>Maintenance</b> page in the backend.

                    To change the default text strings it's not necessary to modify the application code.
                    All you need to do is to create a JSON translation file called <b>en.json</b> and put it in
                    <b>resources/lang</b> folder. The file can be created as a copy from any other translation file,
                    such as <b>resources/lang/de.json</b> for instance. In this translation file you need to keep only those
                    text strings that you would like to override. The left side represents the original text string in English
                    and the right side represents the overridden string. Example:
<pre class="text-white-50">{
    "Crypto Casino": "My custom casino name"
